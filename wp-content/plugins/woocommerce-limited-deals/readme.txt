Ever wanted to create a <strong>Groupon clone</strong>? A site where you can offer deals that only last for a certain period?
With this plugin, you can choose when a product should expire, and how long it should be open to purchase.

Not only can you control expiration of a product, but the product details can be displayed beautifully on a CSS3 banner.
